If you like me are working in Scrum team, and have to give a daily update, but sometime can't remember what you did yesterday,
it is nice to have quick way to store the tasks you have done in a worksheet text file.
There are plenty of similar tools 'out there', but I found them all 'over-engineered, so I made this simply command line tool which
doesn't have a lot of fancy features, but can simply store the tasks easily in a file from the command line. The worksheet text file is stored in the file directory containing this script.

Examples:

Example: Add new task to your worksheet. E.g. that you fixed a bug
ws I fixed bug number xxxx

Example: Show the 10 lines of your work-sheet (just before go to daily scrum meeting :)
